00: Normal Space
4A: Clears previous text on a line (weird form of new line, used in battle text)
4BXXXX: Shortcut to a piece of text, 4B23C9 is the player's name
4C: Starts a new text box
4DXX: Changes text speed, lower numbers are faster (4D02 is default)
4E: Moves to the second line in a text box
4FXX: End of string, 4F00 is normal but 00-04 all seem to be used.

4F00 = Waits for button press, then closes. (Most common, used for normal text)
4F01 = Closes automatically. (Delay depends on text speed?)
4F02 = Waits for button press, but doesn't clear the text or text box graphics.
4F03 = Waits for button press, clears the text but not the text box graphics.
4F04 = Closes automatically, but doesn't clear the text or text box graphics. (Used for questions)
4F05 and higher = Seem to work the same as 4F04.
